# Extraverse

This is a node.js command line utility that turns the current working directory into a pretty online file viewer/editor.

## Design and inspiration

It is based on [martinaglv/cute-files](https://github.com/martinaglv/cute-files) which is based on [tutorialzine's file browser tutorial](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php/). See a live demo [here](http://extraverse.bitcells.com).
